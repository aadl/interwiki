This filter allows you to use interwiki links that point to wikis
such as Wikipedia.org, SourceWatch.org and dKosopedia.com. It can also be
used to link easily to Google and eBay searches and other online reference
sources such as the Merriam-Webster dictionary. It uses a table interwiki 
which is the same table used by <a href="http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/">MediaWiki</a>,
so MediaWiki users should be able to use an interwiki table interchangeably.

Wikipedia has an article with further information about interwikis, which
can be found at:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interwiki
