This module makes it easy to link to wikis and other websites, using a simplified 
"interwiki" syntax, e.g., "[prefix:some term]" creates a hyperlink to the "some term" 
article on the website specified by "prefix." It is also possible to use the "|" character 
to create a "piped link," with display text that is different from the search term.
For example, "[w:public transport|public transportation]" would be translated as a 
reference to the Wikipedia article on "public transport" that displays as:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_transport">public transportation</a>

== Configuration ==
To use this module, you have to take a few steps:

* Install and enable the module in admin/modules.

* Set the appropriate access right in admin/user/configure/permission. 
  The access right is "administer interwiki."

* To add or edit new filters, use admin/interwiki.

NOTE: The "interwiki" table used by this module has the same structure as the 
interwiki table used by the MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia and a number
of other popular wikis. The Wikipedia community also maintains a lengthy prefix  
set that you can grab at:
