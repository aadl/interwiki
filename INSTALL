Pretty much the standard install.

Load the SQL table.

Note, you may want to edit the table to put whatever filters you want in.

You might also want to grab the Media Wiki map
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Interwiki_map

The SQL table is the same table the Media Wiki uses.

When the table is load, turn on the module
(Admin ... modules ...)
and enable the filter 
(Admin ... input formats click on Configure to the right of which ever format
 you want to use, and enable the MediaWiki filter)
